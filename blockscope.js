// a block is defined by curly braces {}

//block is also known as compound statement
 
//block scope means what can be accessed inside a block

//eg {
    
//    { var a =10
//    let b =12
//    const c =15 }

//    console.log(a)

//    console.log(b)

//    console.log(c)
//}

// here var gives result 10 and both let and const shows reference error both of them doesnt work outside block
